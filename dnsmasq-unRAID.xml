    <Description>
        dnsmasq that's easy-ish to configure from the unRAID interface.

        Example use case is getting Minecraft on Nintendo Switch to connect to a self-hosted server.
        1. Set --server=/hivebedrock.network/123.123.123.123
           Where 123.123.123.123 is your server's public IP address.  Or local IP if only playing within your network.
        2. Set the Nintendo Switch's DNS server to an address that'll cause it to use this container as its DNS server.
           Can be this container's private address if on its network.
           Could be a public IP address that port-forwards to this container.
        3. Try to join the "HIVE" featured server; it'll instead join your self-hosted server.
           At time of writing, the server is called "HIVE-o-ween" or similar.

        Note that the Switch's DNS server has to be set to this container *every* time you want to connect to your self-hosted server.

        The --address args are just which DNS servers dnsmasq should use itself for looking things up.
        --server args are your custom entries that won't use "real" DNS.

        If you want ad-blocking too, try changing your --address DNS server IPs to be a Pihole.
